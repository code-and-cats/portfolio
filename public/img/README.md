# Portfolio project

This is my portfolio. The assignment is to make it accessible and follow a design sketch closely.

## The problem

I've used only HTML and CSS for this project. The code is checked by validators and accessibility tools. It should work well on all browsers, most mobile screens, be navigable by keyboard and screen reader.

If I had more time (and probably in the future) I would add JS to populate the projects and links to written words.
